# Cisco ISE Integration with Cisco WLC for Guest Wi-Fi

This repository document has demonstrates how to integrate **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)** with a **Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** to implement **Central Web Authentication (CWA)**. The setup enables secure guest access, BYOD onboarding, and centralized policy enforcement for wireless clientsâ€”ideal for enterprise and government organizations. I have completed this project in a government organization for almost 1000 users. The requirements were :
  i) Device Administration (Tacacs).
  ii) User Access (Radius).
  iii) Central Web Authentication for the guest users (Self-sign login)


## ðŸ“‹ Overview

- **Cisco ISE** acted as the RADIUS server and policy engine.  
- **Cisco WLC** for WLAN creation, client redirection, and VLAN/ACL, policy configuration.  
- **Central Web Authentication** provides a captive portal for guest self-registration and login.  


## ðŸ›  Features

- RADIUS server integration with shared secret synchronization.  
- Authorization Profiles:  
  - `GUEST_Redirect_ISE` â€“ Captive portal redirection.  
  - `Allow_Guest` â€“ Grants network access after authentication.  
- Policy Sets for guest Wi-Fi:  
  - MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) for pre-auth checks.  
  - Authentication and Authorization policies for SSID-based access.  
- Guest Portal with:  
  - Self-registration and temporary password issuance.  
  - Forced password change on first login.  
- Cisco WLC configuration:  
  - MAC filtering and VLAN mapping.  
  - ACL creation for web redirection and post-auth traffic.  
  - CoA (Change of Authorization) support for dynamic policy enforcement.  
- RADIUS l
